Project Title and Description

Foodie – Restaurant Website Design

The Foodie – Restaurant Website is a static website project designed to bring a restaurant’s digital identity to life using only HTML5 and CSS3. Inspired by a Figma design prototype, the project focuses on converting a static design image into a fully functional website.

The aim is not pixel-perfect replication but rather creative approximation, where developers carefully analyze the design, estimate fonts, colors, and spacing, and recreate the layout in code. This approach improves skills in design-to-code conversion, responsive layouts, and styling consistency.

The website highlights a modern restaurant brand with sections such as:

Header & Navigation – For easy movement across pages.

Hero Section – A welcoming area with a bold call-to-action.

Menu Showcase – Featuring delicious food items with images.

About Section – Sharing the restaurant’s story and values.

Footer – Contact details and social media links for engagement.

This project emphasizes clean code, semantic HTML, and creative CSS styling while keeping the site beginner-friendly and visually appealing.
